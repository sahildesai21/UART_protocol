# UART_protocol
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol that uses serial data transmission, allowing devices with different clock rates to communicate without a shared clock signal. It's commonly used in embedded systems, microcontrollers, and computer peripherals for device-to-device communication.

## Key Features of UART:

### Asynchronous Communication:
UART communication doesn't rely on a shared clock signal between the transmitter and receiver, making it suitable for devices with varying clock speeds. 

### Serial Data Transmission:
Data is transmitted bit by bit, one after another, over a single wire (or a pair of wires for full-duplex communication). 

### Full-Duplex or Half-Duplex:
UART can be configured for full-duplex (bidirectional) or half-duplex (one-way) communication.
