# UART_protocol
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is a hardware communication protocol that uses serial data transmission, allowing devices with different clock rates to communicate without a shared clock signal. It's commonly used in embedded systems, microcontrollers, and computer peripherals for device-to-device communication.
